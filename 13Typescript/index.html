<!-- @types/node is used to add type definitions for node and similarly /express for express. It allows typescript to resolve modules using the ES6 module system. They are almost same as import is statically analysed while require is dynamic in nature. import express from "express".

It destructures Router function from express rather than importing entire module. An interface ensures specific type structure, creating it for a todo type forces consistent properties across all todo objects. Named exports allow exporting multiple values from a module with specific names, while default export exports a single value or function as the module's default.
